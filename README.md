For this project, I had to make a personal portfolio using CSS Bootstrap Framework.  

I started by making sure that all links work together.  After importing my own images, I began to build the "portfolio" page, first.  I used one of my personal images to use as a background for all 3 pages.  I was not able to figure ou how to properly size or shape images without making them somewhat distorted, so I added a white border around all the images.

My next step was creating the "Contact Us" page.  For this, I had to rely mostly on Youtube.com, W3schools.com, and mdbootstrap.com in order to get a functioning page.

Lastly, I added some styling to all the text on each page, by citing the Google Fonts page, and importing a specific font to be used.  I added my own CSS document for extra styling.
